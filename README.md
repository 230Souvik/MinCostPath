# MinCostPath

We are given a n*m matrix. Each cell of the matrix has a cost associated to it. We have to return the minimum cost of reaching the destination (n-1,m-1) from the staring cell (0,0).

From any cell we can,

Move 1 cell right.
Move 1 cell down.

Input:

First line contains 2 integers n & m â€“ The dimensions of matrix.
Next n lines contain m integers each specifying the cost associated with each cell.
Output:

Cost of Minimum Possible Path.
